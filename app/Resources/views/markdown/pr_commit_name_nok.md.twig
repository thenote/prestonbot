<!-- PR_COMMIT_NAME_ERROR -->
Hi!

These(s) commit(s) name(s) seems to be incomplete or malformed, regarding our [guidelines](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/How+to+write+a+commit+message):

{% if commits|length > 1 %}
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Malformed commits</th>
  </tr>
  {% for commit in commits %}
    <tr>
        <td>{{ commit }}</td>
    </tr>
  {% endfor %}
</table>
{% else %}
<p>`{{ commits[0] }}` is malformed or incomplete.</p>
{% endif %}

A valid commit name can be, for instance:

```
BO: Shows company in BO search if B2B is enabled
```

Would you mind to amend your commits' names?

To do this, open a command line window and use `git commit --amend` for the commit's name. See [GitHub's help page](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-commit-message/#amending-older-or-multiple-commit-messages) for more information.

_Note: this **must** be done via the command line: you can't do this just by changing the title of the pull-request from the GitHub interface!_ :)

Thank you!
